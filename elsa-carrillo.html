			    <h2>parque Libertad</h2>
			    <p>The Parque Libertad is the main square of the Salvadoran city of Santa Ana. Situated in the center of the city, it is surrounded by historic buildings. This is a place that everyone goes to. There are a lot of local restaurants and it’s a recreational place where every big event happens. This is a place that I feel connected to a lot because it takes 15 minutes to go from my house to there, every single time we would go do something we could take some time and eat something there. I used to go a lot as a child, as a teen, and even now that I am about to become an adult. My parents would always bring me here to play with my cousins and eat things like artisanal ice cream, hot dogs, french fries, and typical food that you can find everywhere around. It means a lot to me and to everyone there. Months ago, because of the corruption that is going on in my city, the park was destroyed and it was built as a new one. A lot of people were mad because there was no need to change anything, memories from years ago left with every single plant and place.

			    <h2>Cathedral</h2>
			    <p>The place where today is the Cathedral of Santa Ana was the central parish, which was built between 1575 and 1576, being destroyed by lightning in the 19th century. It is very meaningful for everyone. This cathedral is one of the prettiest ones in the country, and it’s a landmark for everyone. This Cathedral is close to the park, in fact, the park is in front of it. I wanted to include this because the Cathedral has a yard outside in which there are hundreds of doves, and when it’s 3:00 om they all gather and fly around it. Outside the cathedral there are people selling bags of food for doves, so every kid and even adult always buy this. For me this is a very special place because I grew up coming here as well, everytime I would come to church and then I would play around. I have a lot of pictures of me here and it’s one of the places that I never get tired to visit.

There were presentations every weekend and they would always get full.

			    <p>Lake Coatepeque is a large crater lake surrounded by wooded hills in western El Salvador. This is one of the biggest landmarks of Santa Ana and one of the biggest sources of the economy there. There are a lot of restaurants and places where you can go. There is a lot of local and international tourism here. One of the most important and curious things of this lake is that once a year around the end of the year the water changes its color, it is usually deep blue but when it changes it turns into a beautiful aqua and purple color. No one knows why, but it’s when most people visit this place. I came here a lot, and I cherish this place the most because I don’t have a lot of memories of my parents and me and my brothers, but this is one of the places that we often visited. I carry that memory a lot. I could talk about all the places I know located here, I celebrated a lot of my birthdays here and visited this place to go around the lake in a boat.

			<p><i><b>Places that saw me grow up</b></i></p>

			<p>My map is a representation of the city in which I grew up. Located in Santa Ana, El Salvador, most of my memories are in this city. I haven’t made significant memories here in the United States, but because my city is small, all these places are common landmarks and it didn’t matter how old I was, I would always go to the same places.</p>
			<p>My purpose is to show where I’m from and how my lifestyle would be before coming here to the United States.</p>

			<p><b><i>Personal Landmarks</i></b></p>
			<p><b>Parque Libertad</b>: The Parque Libertad is the main square of the Salvadoran city of Santa Ana. Situated in the center of the city, it is surrounded by historic buildings. This is a place that everyone goes to. There are a lot of local restaurants and it’s a recreational place where every big event happens. This is a place that I feel connected to a lot because it takes 15 minutes to go from my house to there, every single time we would go do something we could take some time and eat something there.

It means a lot to me and to everyone there. Months ago, because of the corruption that is going on in my city, the park was destroyed and it was built as a new one. A lot of people were mad because there was no need to change anything, memories from years ago left with every single plant and place.</p>

			<p><b>Poem</b>: You saw me every weekend, you saw me pass through, you saw me every time I would go to the bus stop and every time I went directly to you. Thank you for letting me play with my friends and let me get shade when I was in my darkest days.</p>

			<p><b>Catedral de Santa Ana</b>: The place where today is the Cathedral of Santa Ana was the central parish, which was built between 1575 and 1576, being destroyed by lightning in the 19th century.
			It is very meaningful for everyone. This cathedral is one of the prettiest ones in the country, and it’s a landmark for everyone. This Cathedral is close to the park, in fact, the park is in front of it. I wanted to include this because the Cathedral has a yard outside in which there are hundreds of doves, and when it’s 3:00 om they all gather and fly around it.

For me this is a very special place because I grew up coming here as well, everytime I would come to church and then I would play around. I have a lot of pictures of me here and it’s one of the places that I never get tired to visit.</p>

			<p><b>Poem</b>: The comfort of the masses held, the comfort of talking to God through your place, every detail of you is beautiful. I hope I can keep making memories with you.</p>

			<p><b>Santa Ana National theater</b>: began in 1902, partly because the city lacked adequate entertainment options and partly. This landmark is for everyone from kids to older people, there is always something that you can watch at the theater, and it’s cheap! For me this place is significant because I used to come with my mom all the time to watch presentations, they were very memorable and I will never forget the number of times I came here. There were presentations every weekend and they would always get full.</p>

			<p><b>Poem</b>: Mesmerizing from outside, mesmerizing from the inside, If there was a place where I feel fancy, it’s here, your colors, the way you were built, this place makes me feel fancy, and whoever visits you feel that way too.</p>

			<p><b>coatepeque lake</b>: Lake Coatepeque is a large crater lake surrounded by wooded hills in western El Salvador. This is one of the biggest landmarks of Santa Ana and one of the biggest sources of the economy there. There are a lot of restaurants and places where you can go.

I carry that memory a lot. I could talk about all the places I know located here, I celebrated a lot of my birthdays here and visited this place to go around the lake in a boat.</p>

			<p><b>Poem</b>: I love this place because of how beautiful the view is, it’s a healing time and it carries all my personal memories, I hope people visit you all the time, I will always come back to remember and to make new memories.</p>

			<p><b>Sihuatehuacan</b>: This park has pools for adults and children with slides, a skating area, an open theater for 2000 people, cabins, picnic areas, toilets, and dressing rooms, kids playground, lifeguards, and park rangers.

			<p><b>Poem</b>: Thank you for being the place in which I had fun all the time, I will never forget what you had to offer and the times I went there if there was a place in which I could go and enjoy my time as a kid, it’s you and its always gonna be you.</p>

			<p><b>C.E.C Madre del Salvador</b>: My school. A place that I didn’t like at first but end up being the most significant place. This is a catholic school to which my parents switched me after years of being in a private school all the time, I made friends and became a member of the band. My passion for music grew even more, and I had a lot of friends, this was one of the last places in which I made memories, I have too many, but the place itself is very important for me.</p>

			<p><b>Poem</b>: Never judge a book by its cover, I never thought that the place I hated the most would turn into the one that was going to make me happier, times were though and new but with time the experience grew.<p>
